  <br>
  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), numerics and coding is what I do for teaching and research. I just love them.
  And I am a strong believer that if you want to test whether you've really understood a subject or not, just go ahead
  and try to teach it to others. If you can do it easily, like in a natural way, and also got somewhat positive feedback,
  it is a good sign that you've really got it yourself. I normally teach these things in my lectures to my students, but
  I just wanted to reach a broader audience and test myself at a larger scale. So, the basic idea here is to force myself
  to prepare educational material to teach how to code flow solvers. Hopefully, you will benefit from these lectures and
  at the same time I will see my weaknesses and get a chance to improve myself.
  <br><br>
  The target audience is senior engineering undergraduates and graduate students, as well as practicing fluid mechanics
  enthusiasts who want to learn how flow solvers work. Those who like to develop their own solvers, or those who want to
  contribute to an open-source CFD library may benefit from these lectures. CFD is very broad when you think of all
  different kinds of applications and flow types. We will be focusing on the fundamentals here, like done in a typical
  classroom setting.
  <br><br>
  I am aware that people prepare these kind of educational stuff as videos these days. New generations prefer to learn from
  videos. It is fine, but I guess I am more like an old-school kind of guy. I also watch a lot of videos myself and learn
  a lot from them, but I am not really good when it comes to preparing such videos. I feel much more comfortable when I
  write things down.

  Each lecture will come together with a code, and the lecture will explain the underlying mathematics of the method used,
  discretization details and the code itself.

  You are expected to have taken introductory level programming, fluid mechanics and numerical methods courses, and
  remember the key concepts. You need to know the Taylor series expansion, how to express truncation errors in big-O
  notation, and how to perform basic finite differencing of derivatives. It will be good if you know methods such as
  the Euler's method that are used to solve initial value problems governed by ODEs. It will also be good if you know
  how to use the finite difference method to solve boundary value problems governed by PDEs. Also how to solve linear
  algebraic equation systems using simple methods such as the Gauss-Seidel method. All these are topics covered in
  introductory level numerical methods courses. We will be mostly using the finite volume method, which is an integral
  type method, so you should better be familiar with vector calculus concepts such as gradients, divergence, Laplacian,
  and integral theorems such as the Gauss divergence theorem. Some of these will be reviewed in the first lecture.
  <br><br>
  We will use C++ for coding, but in its simplest possible form, without any objects or templates. So you should be OK
  even if you do not know any C++ at all. You can easily get a grasp of it by looking at the codes that I'll be sharing.
  It is enough if you know the very basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, etc.
  <br><br>
  For the necessary hardware and software; I'll be using a standard workstation with nothing really special. Any
  laptop or desktop that is not older than 10 years should work. Mine is a bit older than that actually :). I think
  Linux is the best operating system to do number crunching and that is what I'll be using, but Windows with WSL or
  macOS can also be used. I'll be working with the standard GNU C++ compiler. It is a good idea to use its latest
  version that your system allows. Mine is g++ 13.3 right now, which was released about a year ago, as of this writing.
  Older versions should work fine because we will not be using any fancy C++ feature that got introduced recently.
  We may use third party libraries in the future, such as those for numerical algebra, but at the beginning all we
  need is a C++ compiler.
  <br><br>
  <a href="https://www.learncpp.com"> Learncpp.com </a> is a popular C++ tutorial that you may find helpful in case
  you want to study the language a bit before you start. It is very detailed and we'll not be using even 10% of
  what is there. Another popular resource is  <a href="https://www.cppreference.com"> cppreference.com </a>, which is
  a C++ reference site, not a tutorial. There are of course tons of other similar sites, but these two should be more
  than enough to start.
  <br><br>
  You can write your codes in any editor you want but something that can do code completion and syntax highlighting
  will help a lot. I'll be using Visual Studio Code, the popular free code development software from Microsoft. I
  know that nowadays a lot of people like to code with AI assistance, and you can do that if you want, but I like
  to write every single line myself, even though it takes a lot of time and effort. That's how I like it.
